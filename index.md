## PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

Currently a graduate student at University of central Florida, working towards the advancement in computer vision and machine learning. Previously have worked as a Data scientist and a embedded software developer in the field of Computer vision, Onboard Vehicle Diagnostics, Deep Learning, Machine learning and Desktop App development. I have been working with deep learning models and also traditional image processing so as to get the best out of the computer vision models. I would like to call myself a fusion product of Electronics and Computer science
