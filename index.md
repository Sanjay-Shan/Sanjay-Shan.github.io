## PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

I'm passionate about reading tech blogs ,working towards the upliftment of my team. I would say I'm a team player and I take the responsibility when it comes to me and my work , doesn't matter what time of the day it is. I'm here on handshake eagerly  looking to join a group of enthusiastic and passionate people who work towards a common goal. I have a relevant 3 years of experience working in Computer vision and machine learning, but that doesn't stop me from exploring other fields. Coming from a electrical background and lately into Computer science , I would call myself a good blend  of software and engineering , making myself fit for diverse range of opportunities. Apart from the technical aspects , I'm a good listener as well as good a good at noticing things.
